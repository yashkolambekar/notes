#### Procedural Languages

Languages which have one defined steps and procedures and it runs in serial manner. 

#### Functional Languages

Writing a program only using functions and never modify variables. Only create new ones as an output.

Example: Python

#### Object Oriented Programming

Code + Data = Objects

Classes are custom datatypes used to store complex data. Objects are instances of Class and Object oriented programming is basically programming that revolves around Objects.

#### Static Languages

Compiled at the runtime. Errors show up at compile time. We have to declare the datatype before we can use it.

#### Dynamic Languages

Compilation at runtime. Erros show at the time of running. Types of data are assigned at the run time.
